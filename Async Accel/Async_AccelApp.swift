 Initialization chain


 AcceleratorFileSink depends on PerSubjectFileCoordinator

 PerUserSubjectCoordinator (.shared) depends on Subject ID
    It must await a non-nil Subject ID
    Is it a problem that SubjectID is an @EnvironmentObject?

 Subject ID depends on
    being nil if unknown
    set by SubjectIDSheetView
    retrieved by UserDefaults (having previously been set by SubjectIDSheetView)

 _Changing_ Subject ID invalidates
 Subject ID -> PerUserSubjectCoordinator -> AcceleratorFileSink
 */

/*
 For deciding whether to drop the SubjectIDSheetView:
 Just keep the subjectID in Defaults.
 The binding on whether to show the sheet could then be subjectID default = nil or empty
 Don't allow the sheet to cancel/revert
 The sheet holds off until accepted to transfer the value, because otherwise it just rolls up.
 Or maybe just dismiss().
 How do you reset the subject ID? Clear-ID button in Settings. If you have a wrong subject ID you want to replace, then ipso facto you aren't blocked by a sheet.
 Bothersome Scenario:
    The user does a clear-ID
    The ID is cleared.
    The sheet is then signaled to drop, right?
        is this a problem? It does violate
        stability: It's surprising that the settings should be shuttered just by hitting "clear."
        safety/forgiveness: User loses sight of the Settings page (with no clue how to regain it)
            Are all the others applied? Reverted?
 So the guiding principle is that nothing happens, including/especially clears, until the user is done with the settings page entirely, and expresses the desire to do so. I think "expresses the desire" means leaving the tab.
