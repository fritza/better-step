// MARK: - TopPhases

/**
 A `TopPhases` represents a major phase of the application, such as onboarding (`greeting`)  or the two timed walks (`walking`). It is_not_ `OptionSet`.

 There are three levels of sequencing.
 
 - `SeriesTag` identifies the five reporting files. It should not be used for sequencing UI views.
 
 - `TopPhases` identifies the major stage (phase) of the user experience. For example, `walking` stands for the `WalkingContainerView`, which itself manages the sequence of views (instructions, twp walksâ€¦) within that topic. A phase may or may not represent any data stream. There are two for walking, one for usability, and none for the greeting phase.
 
 - `WalkingState` is an example of naming sub-tasks within a phase. `WalkingState` includes `countdown_1`, `walk_1`, `interstitial_2`, and so on.  `TopPhases`, which `TopContainerView` uses to name the top-level sequence of phases within the app  is a special case.
