 ## Primitive data structures

 ### struct DASIQuestion

 * Questions as such: Text, ID, and scoring.
 * The literature identifies questions by 1-based serials: The ID is one more than the index in a _sorted_ `Array` of questions.
 * Read from `DASIQuestions.json`
 * The list is an immutable global: DASIQuestion.questions.
 * THIS IS AN ARRAY, zero-indexed, and it is public.
 * For DASI numbering, refer to the `DASIQuestion.id`. There are also min and max `presenting` values, and a range of valid `presenting`.

 ### struct DASIResponse

 Joins a question (referenced by ID), a response (`AnswerState`) and a time stamp representing which questionj was answered, how, and when  for a **single question**,  It knows how to order itself, and convert itself to a comma-separated string for use in assembling full rows in the output CSV file.

### struct DASIReportContents

An `ObservableObject` intended to be the `@EnvironmentObject` for the DASI project. It takes the Subject ID and initializes its `[DASIResponse]` array of `answers`.

 It serves as the faÃ§ade for the user's responses to the questions.

 * `responseForQuestion(id:)` - yelds the answer (yes/no/unknown) for the question under that ID.
 * `didRespondToQuestion(id:with:) `- replaces the `answers` element for that ID with one with a new `AnswerState`.
 * `unknownResponseIDs` - list of IDs for questions that are as yet `unknown`.
 * `resetQuestion(id:)`  - sets the identified response to `unknown`
 * `reset()` - reset all responses to `unknown`.
 * `csvDASIRecords` - scans all responses, prepares the `csv` representation of each, and returns a `String` containing them delimited by CSV newlines (`\r\n`, per Microsoft's specifications.)

The `String` returned by `csvDASIRecords` can be converted to `Data`, and written out to disk.


 ### QuestionID
 This insulates the 1-based IDs from the 0-based `Array` induces.

 * `RawRepresentable`
 * `Codable`
 * `Hashable`
 * `Strideable`
 * `CustomStringConvertible`
