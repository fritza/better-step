/*
 Yet another archive-structure class (I want all clients to share state) _ought_ to be unnecessary at this stage of the project.
 
 However, it has only now become clear how to integrate the files-as-Data into Archive files with common code; and to share a consistent date, series, and subject ID; plus file names.
 */

/*
 Who should do the file names?
 Can we see if we can leave CSVArchiver alone for that?

/*
 Let's put some discipline on these lazy Archive-related properties.
 
 ZIPArchive:
    There was a deadlock: Couldn't finish without initializing the `archiver` property.
    Couldn't initialize `archiver` in the property declaration, because it needs the destination URL, which needed zipOutputURL, which so far is lazy, as it depends on .zipFileName and documentsDirectory.
 
 The problem with a lazy archiver is that lazy properties delay initialization, but set the value _only once._ This means that you could try nilling-out the archiver property, or leave it in a (probably) used-up condition, but either way, whatever is stored in `archiver` is invalid.
