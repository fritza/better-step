/*
 Yet another archive-structure class (I want all clients to share state) _ought_ to be unnecessary at this stage of the project.
 
 However, it has only now become clear how to integrate the files-as-Data into Archive files with common code; and to share a consistent date, series, and subject ID; plus file names.
 */

/*
 Who should do the file names?
 Can we see if we can leave CSVArchiver alone for that?
